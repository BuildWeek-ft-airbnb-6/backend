### Installation

First, you need to clone the repository with the method of you choice (zip download or https). 
Next, in your command line, navigate to the model directory. Then you can install the required packages with the following command:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
If you use a diffrerent package manager like conda, you should use that command in place of ```pip3```.
